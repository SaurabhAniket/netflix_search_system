Netflix Search and Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a sophisticated search and recommendation system inspired by Netflix's algorithm. Utilizing advanced data engineering techniques, the system will enable users to discover and receive personalized suggestions for movies and TV shows based on their preferences and viewing history.

Key Features:
User-Centric Search: Implement a powerful search functionality that allows users to find titles quickly using keywords, genres, and other filters.
Recommendation Engine: Build a recommendation algorithm leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to suggest titles tailored to individual user tastes.
Data Pipeline: Design and implement an efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to manage the ingestion and processing of vast amounts of Netflix viewing data.
Scalable Architecture: Utilize cloud technologies and microservices architecture to ensure scalability and reliability.
User Interface: Develop an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction with the search and recommendation features.
Technologies Used:
Languages: Python, SQL
Frameworks: Flask/Django for web framework
Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL for data storage
Data Processing: Pandas for data manipulation
Visualization: Matplotlib/Seaborn for data insights
APIs: Integration of external APIs for enhanced movie/TV show data.
